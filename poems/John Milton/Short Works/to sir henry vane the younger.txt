Vane, young in years, but in sage counsel old,
  Than whom a better senator ne'er held
  The helm of Rome, when gowns, not arms, repelled
  The fierce Epirot and the African bold,
Whether to settle peace, or to unfold
  The drift of hollow states hard to be spelled;
  Then to advise how war may best, upheld,
  Move by her two main nerves, iron and gold,
In all her equipage; besides, to know
  Both spiritual power and civil, what each means,
  What severs each, thou hast learned, which few have done.
The bounds of either sword to thee we owe:
  Therefore on thy firm hand Religion leans
  In peace, and reckons thee her eldest son.
