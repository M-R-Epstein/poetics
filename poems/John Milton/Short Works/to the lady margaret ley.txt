Daughter to that good Earl, one President
  Of Englandâ€™s Council and her Treasury,
  Who lived in both unstained with gold or fee,
  And left them both, more in himself content,
Till the sad breaking of that Parliament
  Broke him, as that dishonest victory
  At Chaeronea, fatal to liberty,
  Killed with report that old man eloquent,
Though later born than to have known the days
  Wherein your father flourished, yet by you,
  Madam, methinks I see him living yet:
So well your words his noble virtues praise
  That all both judge you to relate them true
  And to possess them, honoured Margaret.
