A book was writ of late called Tetrachordon,
  And woven close, both matter, form, and style;
  The subject new: it walked the town a while,
  Numbering good intellects; now seldom pored on.
Cries the stall-reader, "Bless us! what a word on
  A title-page is this! and some in file
  Stand spelling false, while one might walk to Mile—
  End Green. Why, is it harder, sirs, than Gordon,
Colkitto, or Macdonnel, or Galasp?
  Those rugged names to our like mouths grow sleek
  That would have made Quintilian stare and gasp.
Thy age, like ours, O soul of Sir John Cheek,
  Hated not learning worse than toad or asp,
  When thou taught’st Cambridge and King Edward Greek.
