When Faith and Love, which parted from thee never,
  Had ripened thy just soul to dwell with God,
  Meekly thou didst resign this earthly load
  Of death, called life, which us from life doth sever.
Thy works, and alms, and all thy good endeavour,
  Stayed not behind, nor in the grave were trod;
  But, as Faith pointed with her golden rod,
  Followed thee up to joy and bliss for ever.
Love led them on; and Faith, who knew them best
  Thy handmaids, clad them oâ€™er with purple beams
  And azure wings, that up they flew so drest,
And speak the truth of thee on glorious themes
  Before the Judge; who henceforth bid thee rest,
  And drink thy fill of pure immortal streams.
